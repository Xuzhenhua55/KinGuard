## Introduction of  KinGuard

Official implementation of KinGuard, a novel black-box fingerprinting framework that achieves both stealth and robustness by embedding structured kinship knowledge into large language models, as presented in our ICASSP paper.

### 📖 Overview
KinGuard addresses the fundamental limitations of existing fingerprinting methods:

❌ Traditional backdoors: Force memorization of trigger-response pairs

❌ Statistical anomalies: Easily detected by perplexity-based detectors

❌ Fragile fingerprints: Vulnerable to fine-tuning and model merging

✅ KinGuard's Solution: Embed structured kinship knowledge that is:

✅ Naturally stealthy (PPL = 14.57 vs. 1048.00 for baselines)

✅ Highly robust (100% FSR after fine-tuning/merging)

✅ Minimally intrusive (preserves model performance)


### ✨ Features

🔍 Black-box Verification - No model parameter access required   

🎯 Knowledge-based Fingerprinting - Uses structured family relationships

🛡️ Attack Resilience - Robust against fine-tuning, perturbation, and merging

📊 Comprehensive Evaluation - 12 benchmark tasks across 3 model architectures

⚡ Easy Integration - Simple API with LLaMA-Factory compatibility   

### 📚 Pipeline

#### 🔧 1.Fingerprint Dataset Construction

##### 🧑‍🧑‍🧒 Family-Member Characterization
We create a structured fingerprint corpus by defining 6 unique individuals across two family networks (Zoe and Lewis families). Each family member is characterized by a quadruple of attributes:

-Personal attributes (pₘ): Demographic information (e.g., occupation: 'software-engineer')

-Personality traits (tₘ): Psychological descriptors (e.g., 'responsible', 'self-disciplined')

-Habits and preferences (hₘ): Lifestyle and tastes (e.g., 'prefers-sausages')

-Relationships (rₘ): Kinship ties to other members (e.g., 'father-of-John')

##### 🏡 Kinship-Aware Graph Construction
-Construct two family networks with 6 unique individuals

-Encode familial relationships in a kinship graph G = (ℱ, ℰ)

-Generate over 300 coherent textual narratives for the fingerprint dataset 𝒟_fp

-Apply textual expansion to create semantic variants of each narrative





#### 👀 2. Ownership Verification Protocol
Black-box Verification Process:

-Partition each fingerprint text sample into prefix (x_pre) and ground-truth continuation (x_next)

-Feed prefix to suspect model to generate output (x_out)

-Calculate ROUGE-N similarity between x_out and x_next

-Compute Fingerprint Success Rate (FSR) using AUC metric



### 🚀 Quick Start


1.Fingerprint Injection with LLaMA-Factory

```
pip install llamafactory
```

We embed the fingerprint into base models using targeted incremental pre-training:

Training Configuration:

```
Learning rate: 5 × 10⁻⁵
Batch size: 16
Epochs: 300
Context window: 1024 tokens
dataset: our-kinguard.jsonl

Supported Models:
LLaMA2-7B
LLaMA3-8B
Qwen-2.5-7B

```
We have already generated our dataset, therefore, you can find it in scripts/our-kinguard.jsonl and use it directly

#### One-Click Training:
```
bash train_fingerprint.sh
```

2.Ownership Verification

Our ownership verification is implemented through a two-step process:

```
verification/
├── sampling.py          # Generates model continuations
├── eval_samia.py        # Calculates FSR metrics
└── verify_fingerprint.sh  # One-click verification script
```


One-click 

```
bash verify_fingerprint.sh

```
